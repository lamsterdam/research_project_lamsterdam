## Introduction
- What is the algorithm/datastructure?
This research report focuses on the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm. 

- What is the problem it solves? 
This algorithm is used in the area of Machine Learning to make classifiactions and predictions based on the proximity of data points to one another. 

- Provide a brief history of the algorithm/datastructure. (make sure to cite sources)


- Provide an introduction to the rest of the paper. 
In this report I will examine the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm in java and will analyze the performance of the algorithm as the size of the training data set increases for odd and even values of k. 


## Analysis of Algorithm/Datastructure
Make sure to include the following:
| Algorithm |  Time | Space | 
| :-- | :-- |  :-- | 
| K-Nearest Neighbours | $O(nlogn)$ | $O(1)$ | 

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
The table above illustrates the time and space complexity for this algorithm. As shown, the time complexity is $O(nlogn)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$. 

- General analysis of the algorithm/datastructure

## Empirical Analysis
- What is the empirical analysis?
- Provide specific examples / data.


## Application
- What is the algorithm/datastructure used for?
- Provide specific examples
- Why is it useful / used in that field area?
- Make sure to provide sources for your information.


## Implementation
- What language did you use?
- What libraries did you use?
- What were the challenges you faced?
- Provide key points of the algorithm/datastructure implementation, discuss the code.
- If you found code in another language, and then implemented in your own language that is fine - but make sure to document that.
